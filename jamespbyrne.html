                    <h3>DNS Resolver</h3>
                    <p>This program was created using Python, the dpkt library, and time library. 
                       Its primary goal is to take input of a URL and output a AAAA record 
                       in the form of an IPv4 address. In this sense, it is comparable to 
                       using the "dig" command through command prompt.</p>

                    <h3>League of Legends Database</h3>
                    <p>This is a group project that utilized MS Access in order to create a database with nine
                        entities for the purpose of keeping record of various in-game statistics. Using the 
                        League of Legends API, we were able to pull game information to populate the tables.
                        I wrote 5 SQL queries to fetch and display informative data from the database.

                <div class="project">
                    <h3>Wireshark Packet Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Using Python in conjunction with the dpkt, os, socket, and struct libraries,
                        this program takes input of a previously captured packet flow between two
                        machines on a network. This program parses the PCAP file and prints out 
                        the source port, source IP, destination port, and destination IP. It also 
                        identifies the number of flows, transactions, and keeps track of the amount of
                        packets and time in order to calculate the throughput.
